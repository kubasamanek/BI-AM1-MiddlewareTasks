# Homework 2

This homework consists solely of logs, as no actual implementation was required. Each task's logs are documented in separate markdown files, along with a clear explanation of the steps taken.

In the results folder, you will find the following markdown files:

1. *telnet_get_request_log.md* – Contains the logs and description of the Telnet GET request.
2. *telnet_post_request_log.md* – Contains the logs and description of the Telnet POST request.
3. *curl.md – Contains the logs* and description of all tasks performed using cURL.
